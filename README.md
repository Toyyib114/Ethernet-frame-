# Ethernet-frame-
This project is about sending an ethernet data-frame with CRC calculation for both transmitter and receiver 

INTRODUCTION 

The aim of this project is test the ability to transmit and receive Ethernet data frames, whose content title and expected sizes 
are based on all technical details as required in compliance with the IEEE 802.3 standard 2005.
Also implemented is this project is cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that allows detection of corrupted data within the entire frame as received on the receiver side , The CRC error detection is based on 32 bit CRC generator , which is the required standard for EThernet.
